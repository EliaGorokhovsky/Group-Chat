# Group-Chat
A class project in many-way communication over ethernet with Raspberry Pi.
This code is based on the CapitalizeServer/Client classes, whose origin is unknown.

These classes were orriginally designed so that the server would simply return the message that the client sent in all upper cases.
This adaptation would theoretically allow the server to send the messages it receives to all clients.
